<h1> Khozoon- A Search Engine</h2>
<h3>It's a search engine designed like google. Khozoon is a bangla world which means "search".</h3>

Explore it <a href="http://codeworld.great-site.net/mySearchEngine/"> Here </a> . Now There's not enough data in the database. 
I encourage you search for "dogs" or "movies" or "elon musk" like these. Also, you have to enter the website in <h2> incognito mode </h2>.
<h4> Cause google has marked this site as deceptive. I don't know why :) </h4>
